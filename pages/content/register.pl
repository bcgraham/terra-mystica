      A valid email address is required, both for administration like
      password resets, and for facilitating email play. The address
      might be shown to any users playing in the same match, but not
      to any outsiders.

      A phone number is optional. If it is provided and the site administrator has 
      enabled it, the number will receive an SMS message as a notification
      when it's the player's turn.
